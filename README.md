This is a multipurpose calculator made by me a student at Cebu Institute of Technology University. The program that I made is a simple multipurpose calculator which contains three major functions which are Conversion, Architecture Math, and Basic Calculator. This program is made by using C programming language which is what we use on our class currently. Note: this program is the application on what I've learned on our subject CSIT121 subject.

## Main Functions

In the current version, there are 3 main functions in the program which are Basic Unit Conversion, Basic Architecture Mathematics, and lastly is the Basic Calculator.<br><br>
These three main function is the highlight of the program. As an architecture or engineering student I am sure that you want to solve things with ease. That's where the program Multipurpose Basic Calculator comes into your service.

## Basic Unit Conversion

This is the first function of the program where you are able to solve some basic unit conversion without having to input the formula in your calculator. Currently there are 6 main conversions on this program which are solving for lengths, area, volume, mass, pressure, and temperature.

## Basic Architecture Mathematics

This is the second function of the program where you are able to solve some equations that are used in architecture wihout having to input the formula in your calculator. Currently there are 12 formulas pre-defined in this program which are solving for the area of a rectangle, the area of a triangle, the area of a circle, the perimeter of a rectangle, the perimeter of a triangle, the circumference of a circle, the volume of a rectangular prism, the volume of a cylinder, the volume of a sphere, the volume of a pyramid, Pythagorean Theorem, finding the slope of a line.

## Basic Calculator

This is the third and final function of the program where you can input two numbers for example (25)(32) and choose an operator (+, -, \*, /).
